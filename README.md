# Mineral Prediction Using Hyperspectral Data

This repository contains code and resources for predicting mineral types using hyperspectral data. Hyperspectral imaging provides high-resolution spectral information that can be used to analyze and classify minerals in geological samples. The project utilizes machine learning models to predict mineral types based on this hyperspectral data.

## About the Project

This project aims to build a machine learning pipeline to predict mineral types from hyperspectral data. Hyperspectral data typically consists of several bands of light captured across a wide range of wavelengths, providing detailed information about the material's composition. Using this data, we can apply various machine learning algorithms, including classification and regression, to predict the mineral composition.

The repository includes:
- Preprocessing scripts for hyperspectral data.
- Machine learning models for classification and prediction.
- Evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for code implementation and experimentation)
